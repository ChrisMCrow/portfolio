      <h1><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
      <div class="content">
        <img src="img/headshot2.jpg" alt="Chris Crow Headshot" id="headshot">
        <p>I am currently enrolled in Epicodus Computer Programming Bootcamp and plan to begin work in the technology industry in early 2019. I’m passionate about design, meticulous with detail, always striving toward greater efficiency, and love working with and leading people.</p>
        <p>My background and bachelors degree are in music technology. I’ve spent my first ten years of work experience leading and motivating teams of volunteers in religious non-profit organizations, producing records, as well as traveling and performing as a musician and entertainer.</p>
        <p>After ten years, I’m ready to embrace some new challenges and expand my technical abilities beyond music recording and production. I hope to bring my experience in leadership as well as my newfound technical skills to the booming technology industry.</p>
        <p>My wife and I live in the greater Seattle area with our newest addition, Asher Bravery, who was born in January of 2018. We love exploring, traveling, and spending time out doors.</p>
